This Basic Calculator app provides a clean and easy-to-use interface with buttons for all the essential mathematical operations. Built with Tkinter, it showcases how you can create interactive GUI applications in Python.<br>


🔧 Features<br>
* ✅ Simple Interface – Clean and easy-to-use graphical interface.<br>
* ✅ Basic Arithmetic Operations – Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br>
* ✅ Clear Screen – Clear the screen with the "C" button.<br>
* ✅ Decimal Support – Handle decimal numbers and operations.<br>

🛠️ How It Works<br>
1. Button Interface: Each button represents a number or operation (e.g., 1, 2, +, -, =).<br>
2. Input Handling: When you click on buttons, it updates the screen with the corresponding number or operator.<br>
